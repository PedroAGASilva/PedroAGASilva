## Projects

Here are some of the projects I've been working on:

### Belt Selection App
Link coming soon: This project involves the development of a power transmission belt selection application entirely in Excel. The app helps engineers and designers select the appropriate belts for power transmission systems, considering factors such as power requirements, angular speed, and pulley sizes.

### Web Automation Scripts for Social Media
Link coming soon: In this project, I've created automation scripts using Python and Selenium IDE to automate the account creation process and perform navigation tasks on various social media platforms. These scripts help save time and streamline social media management tasks.
