# Hi there! 👋

I'm Pedro AGA Silva, a Mechanical Engineer with a passion for programming and developing automation tools. I enjoy combining my technical knowledge with programming skills to create efficient solutions for various tasks. Welcome to my GitHub profile!

## About Me

🔧 Mechanical Engineer by profession, programmer by passion.
🌱 Currently exploring the realms of software development and automation.
💡 Interested in building tools and applications to streamline processes.
⚙️ Proficient in Python, C++ and Assembly.
🎓 Constantly learning and expanding my knowledge in the field of programming and IT.

## Projects

Here are some of the projects I've been working on:

### Belt Selection App
Link coming soon: This project involves the development of a power transmission belt selection application entirely in Excel. The app helps engineers and designers select the appropriate belts for power transmission systems, considering factors such as power requirements, angular speed, and pulley sizes.

### Web Automation Scripts for Social Media
Link coming soon: In this project, I've created automation scripts using Python and Selenium IDE to automate the account creation process and perform navigation tasks on various social media platforms. These scripts help save time and streamline social media management tasks.

### Game Automation Scripts
Link coming soon: This project demonstrates my game automation scripts tailored for arcade gaming. These Python scripts enable the automation of specific game actions, allowing for extraordinary performance and achieving results that surpass human capabilities in arcade games.
